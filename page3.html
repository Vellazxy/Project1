				<p>V: Hi, nice to see you. My name is Vella.
				<br>L: Hey, my name’s Lily. Nice to see you too.
				<br>V: Um, what did it do during winter break?
				<br>L: After school ended, I went to Orlando with my friends for three days and then I went back to China on Christmas.
				<br>	V: Oh, What did u do during the days in Orlando?
				<br>	L: We just visited the parks there and universal studio. There is also another one but I forgot the name.
				<br>	V: Was it warm there? How was the weather?
				<br>	L: Yea, it was around 20 degrees. (Celsius)
				<br>	V: That's cool. I got back immediately after the semester ends and then,
				<br>	L: Understandable.
				<br>	V: And uh, because most of my friends, they went to the college in China, so when I got back, most of them are still like working hard for the finals, so I was pretty bored for like one or two weeks without doing anything. Um, I think I just get up pretty late. And then had a lunch and then go back to take a nap and then
				<br>	L: Sounds fun.</p>

Yeah, the mountains there are pretty special. Um, yeah. Nothing really impressive, I think.But I guess I just have some relaxing days there.
				<br>L: How was the weather?
				<br>V: Uh, the weather… I still need to wear jackets, but the weather is warmer than my hometown.
				<br>L: Where is your hometown?
				<br>V: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=shaoxing">Shaoxing, Zhejiang</a>.
				<br>L: Mine is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=hangzhou">Hangzhou</a>.
				<br>V: That's pretty close! Yeah, one of my friends from Australia, she got an internship so she's pretty busy but I hang out with my friend after she finished her work and we went to have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sichuan+spicy+food">Sichuan spicy Food</a>. What did you do after you got back to China?
				<br>L: I just stayed up home an definitely had a healthier lifestyle. I went to bed around 11 o’clock because my parents forced me to do so. So I think I've got a lot of sleep, which is nice.

				<p>V: Yea, when do you usually go to sleep in New York city after school?
				<br>L: Around 12 to one
				<br>V: Not too bad.
				<br>L: Yea, compared to other. Yeah.
				<br>V: I feel like it's a big difference compared final and then got back to home.  During finals, you are so busy that you even didn't really have time to have meals sometimes and then you got back home, you just have three meals every day and then got enough sleep like completely enough
				<br>L: Yea so true. And using my phone all the time.
				<br>V: Did you feel bored at home
				<br>L: Yea, after two weeks
				<br>V: Did you try to find something?
				<br>L: I helped my mom to cook. We visited a temple in my hometown. That was fun.
				<br>V: I was trying to help my parents cooking. But grandparents are home during that days because it's close to Chinese new year and then they will not let you do anything.
				<br>L: Yea I know!
